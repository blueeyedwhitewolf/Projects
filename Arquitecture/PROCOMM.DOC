          ProComm 2.3                                          Preface





                             PREFACE TO VERSION 2.3
                             ----------------------



          Changes  to version  2.3 are summarized in the  accompanying
          file PRCM23.NEW. This manual has been updated to reflect the
          current status of the product.

          The parm file once again grew. If you are using 2.1 or above
          don't worry about it, it'll change automatically.

          A number of  script commands  have been added, and some have
          changed or left. The %YS commands no longer exist.





                             PREFACE TO VERSION 2.2
                             ----------------------


          One major  change worth  mentioning here is the switch to an
          overlay  structure.  This  switch,  coupled  with  extensive
          enhancements, has resulted in an executable file quite a bit
          larger  than  that  of  previous  versions. However,  actual
          memory requirements have been reduced.

          Once again the parameter file has also increased in size. If
          you are running version 2.1 the .PRM  file will be converted
          to  the  2.3  format  with  all  of your previously  defined
          options intact. If you are using earlier versions of ProComm
          a completely new parameter file will be created.

          Quite a number of script file commands have been changed. It
          is advised that you  check  all  previously created  command
          files before relying upon them for unattended operation.

          In  addition, several  keystrokes  for  commands  have  been
          changed,  most  notably   in  the  terminal  emulations.  We
          apologize for the inconvenience  this causes, but we felt it
          was justified in terms of overall funtionality.

                             USER SUPPORTED SOFTWARE
                             -----------------------



          User-supported   software  is  a  means  for  the  computing
          community  to  receive  quality   software   while  directly
          supporting software authors. It is based on the ideas that:


               The value  and utility of  software is best assessed by
               the user  on his  or her own system. Only after using a
               program  can  one  really determine  whether  it serves
               personal applications, needs and tastes.

               The  creation of independent personal computer software
               can and should be supported by the computing community.

               Copying of programs should  be encouraged, rather  than
               restricted.  The  ease  with  which   software  can  be
               distributed  outside  traditional  commercial  channels
               reflects the  strength,  rather than  the  weakness, of
               electronic information.


          Under the user  supported concept, anyone may request a copy
          of  a user-supported program  by  sending a blank, formatted
          disk  to the program  author  together  with  an  addressed,
          postage-paid  return  mailer.  A  copy of the program, along
          with  documentation,  will be  sent by  return  mail on  the
          user's disk.

          The program carries a notice suggesting registration for the
          program. Registration is voluntary on your part.

          Regardless of  whether  you register,  you are encouraged to
          copy  and   distribute  the   program   for   the   private,
          non-commercial use of others.

          In order to  support our  users, and to provide a  means  of
          distribution,  we have implemented  a  bulletin board system
          you can use to communicate with us. If you have questions or
          comments  just call us up and leave  a  note.  In your note,
          describe  as completely  as  possible  the  problem  you are
          having. Let us know your machine configuration, your ProComm
          configuration and version and any resident  software you are
          using. Describe what  steps  you  take  before  the  problem
          occurs, and exactly what the program does when it occurs. If
          you do  not provide  us  with a complete description  of the
          problem there is little we can do to help. We'll do our best
          to keep you up and  running, but if you are not a registered
          user we do not guarantee to provide support of any kind.

          You'll always be able to find the latest  version of ProComm
          on  the BBS. The number for our board is (314) 449-9401. The
          board is operational 23 hours per day, 4:00am-3:00am CST. We
          are using the Fido BBS Network system from Tom Jennings. You

                                  INTRODUCTION
                                  ------------



          ProComm is  a general purpose communications program with  a
          wealth  of  features.  It  was  written  in  "C"  with  some
          assembler routines  for  optimum  performance.  We  hope you
          enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed writing it.


          PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
          -------------------


          ProComm was designed to provide pleasant  access to the kind
          of tasks  we thought a  communications program should offer.
          Included in its features are:


               The ability to emulate a number of popular terminals.

               A dialing directory containing one hundred entries.

               Auto  redial facilities  for  connecting with  hard  to
               reach numbers.

               Several  popular   file  transfer  protocols  including
               XMODEM, Kermit, Telink and more.

               Command files to control automatic logon and unattended
               operation.

               A  DOS gateway which allows you to execute DOS commands
               or other programs while you're still on-line.

               And a host of other goodies including keyboard  macros,
               disk and printer logging and much much more.


          MACHINE REQUIREMENTS
          --------------------


          ProComm requires 128K of available RAM to execute  properly.
          That's  128K in addition  to  the operating  system  and any
          resident programs.  It runs under  MS-DOS on the IBM PC, XT,
          AT  or any  close  compatible. It  may be used with either a
          color, composite or monochrome display.

          ProComm may have a number of files open at once so make sure
          that  the FILES parameter in  your CONFIG.SYS file  is large
          enough.  We  suggest using FILES=15 or greater. Consult your
          MS-DOS manual for a discussion of the CONFIG.SYS file.

          ProComm 2.3                                     Introduction





          PROCOMM FILES
          -------------


          ProComm creates and uses several files. They are:


               PROCOMM.PRM     Default parameter file

               PROCOMM.DIR     Dialing directory file

               PROCOMM.KEY     Keyboard macro file

               PROCOMM.XLT     Translate table file

               PROCOMM.HST     Host mode audit trail

               PROCOMM.MSG     Host mode welcome (user created)


          ProComm  uses the  environment variable  PROCOMM= to tell it
          where  to look for  its  files.  It  will first  search  the
          current directory  for the needed  file. If it is not there,
          ProComm will search the directory pointed to by PROCOMM=. If
          it  is found in neither place, and  needs to  be created, it
          will be created in the directory pointed  to by PROCOMM=. If
          the environment variable  is not set, files will be  created
          in the current directory.

          You may set this variable by issuing the DOS command:

               SET PROCOMM=pathname

          where 'pathname' is a fully qualified path name  ending with
          a  backslash.  You  may  issue this command from either  the
          command line or from a batch file. For instance, if you have
          the  command SET PROCOMM=C:\COMM\PROCOMM\  in  your autoexec
          file,  ProComm will  know  to  look  for  its  files  in the
          C:\COMM\PROCOMM  directory and  you can use the program from
          anywhere on  your  system and  have just one  set of ProComm
          files.

          Clear the environment variable by saying:

               SET PROCOMM=

          Consult  your   MS-DOS  manual  for   more   information  on
          environment variables.

          ProComm 2.3                                 Program Features





                                PROGRAM FEATURES
                                ----------------





          STARTING THE PROGRAM
          --------------------


          Begin a ProComm session by issuing the command:

               PROCOMM [/S] [/B] [/Ffilename] [/M]

          Command line switches may appear in  any  order, but must be
          separated by at least one blank.

          Including  a '/S'  on  the command line  suppresses  ProComm
          produced sound effects. It does not affect beeps (^G) coming
          from the remote computer or the alarm function,  nor does it
          control the modem speaker. You can change the  default sound
          setting using the setup (ALT-S) screen.

          The '/B' option may be used to run the program in black  and
          white.  This is useful  for users  with  composite  monitors
          attached  to color  graphics  display cards.  If the '/B' is
          omitted ProComm will automatically  adjust itself for either
          color or  monochrome  operation.  To  make  black  and white
          operation  the default, begin  a ProComm  session using  the
          '/B' option.  then save the current  colors using  the ALT-Z
          facility.

          Specify  '/F' with  a filename  to execute  a  command  file
          immediately  upon  program   startup.  Command   files   are
          described later in this chapter.

          The '/M'  option sets  ProComm to  perform  screen  displays
          using BIOS  calls, rather than direct screen writes. This is
          useful for  running  under  multi-tasking operating systems.
          Screen write method  is  also selectable  through the  setup
          facility.

          When  the program  begins it displays  the ProComm logo  and
          copyright  notice,  and  possibly  the  program  information
          screen. This brief commercial occasionally  presents  itself
          the  first few times  you  use  the  program.  You  can also
          display the information screen using the ALT-I command.

          ProComm 2.3                                 Program Features





          TERMINAL MODE
          -------------


          After the opening  display  and the  initialization  of  the
          program,  you  are  left  in  terminal mode.  Most  of  your
          communicating will  take  place here. The bottom line of the
          screen is  reserved  for messages but the rest of the screen
          is  open  for  use. Most ProComm  features are  called  from
          terminal mode. They are usually executed from a window which
          leaves your original screen intact. Press ALT-F10 for a list
          of  available  commands.  You  may  then  select  an  option
          directly from the help screen.


          Terminal Emulations
          -------------------


          Most  keyboard and screen functions  will operate locally as
          you expect them  to.  What  they  do  on the remote computer
          depends on which  terminal emulation you are  using. ProComm
          currently supports ten popular terminal configurations:


                              - IBM 3101
                              - DEC VT-100
                              - DEC VT-52
                              - Televideo 910/920
                              - Televideo 925/950
                              - Lear Siegler ADM-3/5
                              - Heath/Zenith 19
                              - ANSI-BBS
                              - ADDS Viewpoint
                              - Wyse 100


          To change the emulation  in use,  select TERMINAL SETUP from
          the setup screen (ALT-S).

          Consult appendix A for a list of the functions supported for
          each terminal.


          COMMUNICATION PARAMETERS
          ------------------------


          ProComm supports a variety of communications configurations.
          You  may select baud rate, the number of data and stop bits,
          parity  and  duplex.  The  program  defaults   to  300  baud
          operation, with 8  data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity and echo
          off (full duplex).

          ProComm 2.3                                 Program Features





          Use  the ALT-P  command to review or change  the active line
          control   parameters.  After   opening   the   Communication
          Parameter  window, ProComm  displays  the current  settings.
          Enter  a number from  1  to 12 to  change  to  a  predefined
          setting. Use  the numbers  13 thru  19 to setup a customized
          configuration. Enter 20 to select COM1  as your active port,
          or 21 to use COM2.

          Use the save option (22) to make the  new configuration your
          default. If you change the parameter settings without saving
          them  to disk,  they  will  only  be  used  for the  current
          session.

          Press ESC to return to terminal mode. The new parameters are
          now in affect.


          OUTPUT STRING TRANSLATION
          -------------------------


          There  are several situations in which ProComm will  perform
          translation on strings sent to  the modem. These include the
          modem  initialization string,  the  modem  command,  dialing
          directory  numbers,  long  distance  codes,  keyboard  macro
          strings,  and  the  %T,  %N  and  %J  script  commands.  The
          translation allows you to send carriage returns, escapes and
          other control characters to the  modem, and  also provides a
          pause feature.

          ProComm  manages this  by providing  translation  characters
          which   can  be  specified  in  the  general  setup  screen.
          Characters are provided for CR, ESC, CTRL-char and pause.

          The  default CR  translation  character  is  the exclamation
          point  ('!').  Anytime  that  ProComm   encounters   the  CR
          translate character in one of the above mentioned strings it
          replaces  that  character with a CR (ASCII 13). To  send the
          character without translation use two of them together.  For
          instance, in the default case where  '!' is the CR translate
          character, a keyboard  macro set  to 'PASSWORD!'  sends  the
          string 'PASSWORD'  followed by a carriage return. A keyboard
          macro  set to 'GO AWAY!!' will be translated  as 'GO AWAY!'.
          Since two of  the characters  in a row are translated as the
          true character, some other  method is necessary to  send two
          adjacent  carriage  returns.  You  can  do  this  using  the
          CTRL-char translation  described below. For instance, if the
          CTRL translate character  is  set  to the  caret  ('^')  the
          string '^M^M' is  translated as  2 carriage returns (because
          CTRL-M is a CR).

          The  default ESC  translation character  is the vertical bar
          ('|').  Anytime that  ProComm encounters  the ESC  translate
          character in one of the above mentioned strings  it replaces


          Copyright (C) 1986 PIL Software Systems                   10



          ProComm 2.3                                 Program Features





          that character with an ESC (ASCII 27). To send the character
          without  translation use two of them together. For instance,
          in   the  default  case  where  '|'  is  the  ESC  translate
          character,  a keyboard  macro set to '|[2J'  sends the VT100
          command  for clear screen (ESC [ 2 J). A  keyboard macro set
          to '|| box ||' will be translated as '| box |'. Since two of
          the  characters   in  a  row  are  translated  as  the  true
          character,  some  other  method is  necessary  to  send  two
          adjacent  escapes.  You  can  do  this  using the  CTRL-char
          translation  described  below. For  instance,  if  the  CTRL
          translate  character is  set  to the caret ('^') the  string
          '^[^[' is translated as 2  escapes  (because  CTRL-[  is  an
          ESC).

          The  CTRL  character translation is  slightly  different. In
          this  case  the  CTRL  translate  character  is  a  lead  in
          indicator that the following character should be interpreted
          as  a CTRL character. For instance, using  the  default CTRL
          translate character '^' the string '^C' would be interpreted
          as  a  CTRL-C  (ASCII  3).  Again,  2  translate  characters
          together are treated as the actual character, so '^^C' would
          be translated  as  '^C' (the  caret character  followed by a
          capital C).

          The final translate character provided is the pause. If this
          character  is encountered  during translation,  ProComm will
          pause for 1/2 second before doing anything else. The default
          translate pause character  is the tilde  ('~'). This  one is
          different  from the  other translate characters  in  that  2
          pause characters  together cause  a 1 second pause; they are
          NOT interpreted as  the  single  character. If  you  wish to
          actually  send that character you must change  the setup for
          the pause translate character.

          Notice the difference between the translate  pause character
          and a modem pause  character. The  translate pause character
          causes a pause in characters being sent to  the  modem. This
          is appropriate for pauses  around a modem escape code, as in
          a  hang-up  string,  or to  allow the  modem  to  respond to
          something before  continuing. A  modem pause character, such
          as  the  comma  used by Hayes, causes a  pause in characters
          sent from the modem to the phone line. It is appropriate for
          waiting  for second  dial tones  and  such, as when  you are
          dialing out  through a  PBX or office  phone system. The two
          are NOT the same and should not be confused.


          SETUP SCREEN
          ------------


          ProComm allows  you  to  define  many of your  own power  up
          defaults  for  system  parameters.  You can  also  change  a
          setting temporarily, and  go back to  your defaults for  the

          ProComm 2.3                                 Program Features





          next  session.  To  access the setup  routine,  press ALT-S.
          Setup is currently  divided  into 6  sections:  modem setup,
          terminal setup, Kermit setup, general setup, host mode setup
          and ASCII file transfer setup.

          Select a section by typing  its number  and pressing return.
          You will be presented  with a screen containing  the current
          defaults for that section.  To change a  setting,  enter the
          number of the parameter followed by  a  CR.  Then  make your
          change.  If, after selecting a parameter, you  decide not to
          change it,  simply  press ESC. The current value will remain
          unchanged.

          If the  parameter chosen requires a  string, simply  type in
          the  characters for the  new  string followed  by a carriage
          return. Pressing CR  without typing any  characters will set
          the string to null.

          Some parameters offer you a selection of valid values. Press
          the space bar to  rotate between values.  When the value you
          desire is displayed, press CR to accept it.

          If the parameter  requires a  number,  enter the number  and
          press return.  ProComm will  check to  make  sure  that  the
          number falls within a valid range.

          To exit a setup section, press ESC. If  you wish to save the
          changes  you have to  disk,  select option 5  from  the main
          setup option list.  If you  select  this option the  current
          settings will  become your  power-up default. If  you do not
          save the setup, the changes you have made will be in  effect
          for only the current ProComm session.

          To exit the main setup screen press ESC.


          Modem Setup
          -----------



          Modem Initialization String

          This is  the string sent to the modem every time you begin a
          ProComm session. It  may be up  to 46 characters  in length,
          and may contain carriage returns or control characters using
          the translate conventions described in the section on output
          string  translation.   Modem  initialization   strings  vary
          between different types of modems. The default is configured
          for  a Hayes  or compatible modem. It is 'AT E0 S7=60 S11=55
          S0=0 V1 X1', where

               AT      is the command prefix

          The initialization  string  may  be  tailored  to  suit your
          particular  modem and  needs. Consult your  modem manual for
          details regarding  the operation and available commands  for
          your modem.

          Dialing Command

          The dialing command is  used to instruct the modem to dial a
          number.  It is  sent  to  the modem  by  the dial  or redial
          functions,  followed  by  a  number  to  dial and  any  long
          distance codes  you  might  specify. The default  is  'ATDT'
          where:

               AT      is the command prefix
               D       is the dial command
               T       turns on touch tone dialing

          The modem  dialing command may contain imbedded pauses, CRs,
          ESCs and CTRL  characters using the conventions described in
          the section on output string translation.

          Connect String

          This is the message  your modem sends to ProComm to indicate
          that  a   connection  has  been  achieved.  It  defaults  to
          'CONNECT'.  ProComm uses  this  value during auto  redial to
          determine  when  a connection has been  made. Note that this
          parameter must be  set correctly  (including  case) for  the
          redial (ALT-R) feature to work.

          Modem No Connect Strings

          These strings are also used by the auto redial feature. They
          should  be  set to  modem  messages  that  indicate  that  a
          connection  was  not  achieved.  The  defaults  are  'BUSY',
          'VOICE' and  'NO CARRIER'. Again, they must be exact matches
          to  the messages your modem  displays, including case.  Some
          modems  do   not   support  these  extended  call   progress
          monitoring features.

          Hang-up String

          The hang-up string is the command to be sent to the modem to
          cause it to hang up. ProComm first  attempts to  hang-up  by
          dropping the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) line. If that is  not
          successful  it  will  send  this string  to  the modem.  The
          default,   set   up   for   Hayes   and    compatibles,   is
          '~~~+++~~~ATH0!', where:

               ~~~     is a 1 1/2 second delay
               +++     is the modem escape sequence
               ~~~     is a 1 1/2 second delay
               AT      is the modem command prefix
               H0      is the hang-up command
               !       sends a CR

          The '~'  and '!'  characters are translated  by ProComm, not
          the modem  (see the section on output  string  translation).
          The '+++'  surrounded by the 1  1/2 second pauses causes the
          modem to go into command state, where the hang-up command is
          then issued. For more  information  see  the section on  the
          ALT-H command.

          Redial Timeout Delay

          This is the number of seconds that ProComm will wait, during
          a redial,  for a  connect  or no  connect response  from the
          modem.  If the  timeout  delay is exceeded  before  a  modem
          response is received, ProComm will cycle and attempt another
          redial. This value may  also be modified on the fly during a
          redial attempt.  See  the  section  on  re-dialing for  more
          details.

          Redial Pause Delay

          The redial pause delay is the number of seconds that ProComm
          will  pause  between  each dialing attempt during  a redial.
          This  is needed  by some modems to reset  between calls. The
          default, and the minimum pause time, is 1 second.

          Modem CD Mask

          The  modem  Carrier  Detect  mask  is  used  by  ProComm  to
          determine whether or not a hang-up has  been successful. The
          default  value  is  32.  It  may  be necessary  for  you  to
          experiment  with  this  parameter in order  to determine the
          correct  value.  Values  tried  should  powers  of  2,  i.e.
          16,32,64 and 128. In general, if the hang-up command (ALT-H)
          correctly reports the results of  the  hang-up attempt, then
          the  CD  mask  is   correct.  If  the  hang-up  attempt  was
          successful, but reports that the call  was not disconnected,
          or vice versa, then the CD mask is  incorrect. The following
          values may be used as guidelines, although cabling and other
          considerations may make them inaccurate:

               16      Hayes external, Prentice POPCOM
               32      USR Courier, Cermetek Security Modem
               128     Hayes internal, Qubie, USR Password
                       Rixon R212A

          See  the  section on  the hang-up  (ALT-H) command for  more
          details.

          Terminal Setup
          --------------



          Terminal Emulation

          Use  this parameter  to  select  the  terminal  you wish  to
          emulate. After selecting option 1, press the space bar until
          the  terminal desired is displayed. Then  press  CR  to make
          that  the  current emulation. Take care to  insure that  the
          rest  of  the  settable  terminal  parameters match what  is
          expected  for the terminal type you select.  For general BBS
          work ANSI-BBS is suggested.

          Duplex

          Control the default duplex setting here.  Your  choices  are
          full duplex (no echo) and half duplex (local echo).  If what
          you  type is not displayed  on  the  screen, try using  half
          duplex. If  you see  two  of every  character you type, give
          full duplex a shot.

          Handshake

          There is currently  only 1  handshake  that  is available to
          ProComm users:  XON/XOFF. If you desire  to  use handshaking
          set this  option to XON/XOFF, otherwise select NONE. ProComm
          performs  XON/XOFF  at  the   interrupt  level.  To  prevent
          deadlock due  to  extraneous  XOFFs  caused  by  line  noise
          ProComm allows you to reset the XOFF flag. If you ever see a
          message on  the  status  line  that  indicates  an XOFF  was
          received,  and you don't  think it is  valid,  just hit ESC.
          That will  clear  the XOFF  flag and  allow you to  continue
          work.

          Incoming Carriage Return Translation

          Use this to set the power  up default for  incoming carriage
          return translation  Some systems  send only a CR  and expect
          you to provide the line feed,  while others send both the CR
          and LF.  If this  parameter is set to  CR, incoming carriage
          returns  are  left  alone.  If  set to  CR/LF,  any carriage
          returns  received  from the  remote  will  have  a line feed
          appended  to  them  by   ProComm.   Most   TTY  applications
          (including most BBSs) send both the carriage return and line
          feed, so the  ProComm default  is CR.  You can  change  this
          setting on the fly without affecting the default  using  the
          ALT-F3 command.

          Outgoing Carriage Return Translation

          Use  this to set  the power up default for outgoing carriage
          return translation Some systems need only  a CR,  and others


          Copyright (C) 1986 PIL Software Systems                   15



          ProComm 2.3                                 Program Features





          desire a CR/LF combination.  If this parameter is set to CR,
          outgoing  carriage returns are left alone. If  set to CR/LF,
          any carriage  returns sent  to the  remote will have a  line
          feed appended to them by ProComm.

          BS Translation

          The   backspace   (BS)   keystroke   can   have    different
          interpretations depending  upon  the terminal  type. In most
          cases it is destructive, that  is the cursor will delete the
          character to the  left  when it moves there.  In some cases,
          the VT100 for instance,  the BS behaves  like a  cursor left
          command.  You  may  choose the  correct  behavior  for  your
          application using  this parameter. The  ProComm  default  is
          destructive.

          Line Wrap

          The line wrap setting  controls how lines  greater  than  80
          characters  are  handled.  If set on, those lines will  wrap
          around  and be displayed on the next  line.  With  line wrap
          off,  lines  greater  than 80 characters in  length  will be
          truncated. The ProComm default is line wrap off.

          Scroll

          The  scroll  parameter  controls  what  happens  if  ProComm
          receives a  CR (or CR/LF) while  the cursor is positioned in
          the bottom line. If scroll is on, the screens scrolls 1 line
          and the  new line can be  printed.  If  scroll is  off,  the
          cursor returns  to the left most  column, and  the  new line
          over prints  the old.  Normally this will always be  set on.
          For some  full screen  applications you may need  to inhibit
          screen scrolling.

          Answerback

          Some  systems send  an ENQ  control character  (CTRL-E)  and
          expect an identifying sequence to be returned. If ANSWERBACK
          is set ON,  ProComm will  respond to  a received  CTRL-E  by
          sending the keyboard macro assigned to  ALT-0. If ANSWERBACK
          is OFF, the CTRL-E will be ignored. As CTRL-E can be a valid
          graphics  character   on  the  IBM  PC,  ANSWERBACK  is  not
          supported while in ANSI-BBS terminal emulation mode.


          Kermit Setup
          ------------


          We  have  provided  control  over  a number  of Kermit  file
          transfer parameters. This is not the place, however, to give
          a Kermit  tutorial. If  you do not know what  these are, you
          should  leave  them  as   they  are.  Consult   the   system

          available in the file transfer section.


          General Setup
          -------------



          Editor Name

          This parameter  can be set to the name of an editor  or list
          program you wish to use from within ProComm. You may specify
          it    as    a    complete   filename    with   path    (i.e.
          C:\WP\EDIT\EDITOR.EXE),  just   the  program   name  without
          extension (i.e. EDITOR) or  anything in between. If  no path
          is specified, ProComm will search  the directories specified
          in the environment variable PATH for the indicated file. You
          must have enough available RAM to load the desired program.

          Default Log File

          Use this  parameter to  set the default name for the file to
          be used when file logging is in effect. If  the file exists,
          new  data will be appended to its end. If the  file does not
          exist it will be created in the current directory.

          Default Screen Dump File

          This option names  the file to which to append screen dumps.
          If  it  does  not exist when ALT-G is  pressed  it  will  be
          created in the current directory.

          Screen Write Method

          ProComm can use one of two different methods to perform  its
          screen writing. Normally you  would use DIRECT screen writes
          for  speed.  In  some cases,  such  as  under  multi-tasking
          operating systems, you might wish to go through the BIOS for
          screen writing. You may also select BIOS mode using the '/M'
          command line option.

          Translate Table

          This  setting  controls  whether  or  not   translate  table
          conversion is performed. Selecting YES causes the  translate
          table  to be activated  immediately, as  well  as on program
          startup.  The translate  table may  be  defined  and toggled
          on/off using the ALT-W command as well.

          Sound Effects

          The  sound  effects   option   controls  the  existence   or
          suppression of ProComm sound effects. This setting  controls
          the window opening  and closing  noises primarily, and  does
          not  effect the alarm, the modem or bells (^G) sent from the
          host.

          Alarm Sound

          This  setting controls  whether or not  the alarm uses sound
          effects. The alarm  is  used to  indicate  the end  of  file
          transfers, connects  during re-dials  and by the  %A  script
          command. If alarm sound is ON,  these events will trigger an
          alarm clock like ringing which will continue  for the number
          of seconds specified by the alarm time below. If alarm sound
          is OFF, the appropriate message will flash for the indicated
          time but will be silent.

          Alarm Time

          Set this to the time (in seconds) that you wish the alarm to
          sound. For instance, if you desire to have the file transfer
          alarm ring for two minutes, set this to 120.

          Exploding Windows

          Beginning  with version 2.2  you  may  select what  type  of
          windows  you wish ProComm to use.  By selecting YES for this
          option you instruct  ProComm to use exploding windows, as it
          did  in  previous versions. Selecting  NO causes windows  to
          just appear without the expanding frames.

          XMODEM Mode

          Some remote  systems, such  as CompuServe, cannot handle the
          normal  XMODEM  error timings. For these  systems,  set  the
          XMODEM  mode to RELAXED to avoid file transfer aborts due to
          timing  errors.  In most  cases  this should be  be  set  to
          NORMAL.

          Translate Pause Character

          Use this  parameter to set  the  character which  is  to  be
          interpreted as a pause during output string translation. See
          the section on output string translation for more details.

          Translate CR Character

          Use  this  parameter to set  the character  which  is  to be
          interpreted  as  a  carriage  return  during  output  string
          translation. See  the  section on output string  translation
          for more details.

          Translate CTRL Character

          Use  this  parameter  to set the character  which  is  to be
          interpreted  as signaling a control  character during output
          string  translation.  See  the   section  on  output  string
          translation for more details.

          Translate ESC Character

          Use this parameter to  set  the  character  which  is to  be
          interpreted as an ESC  during output string translation. See
          the section on output string translation for more details.

          Aborted Download

          Use  this setting to determine the disposition of files that
          are aborted during downloads. If  set to KEEP, these partial
          files are kept on  the disk and  are your responsibility. If
          set to DISCARD,  they  are erased  from  your  disk when the
          download aborts.


          Host Mode Setup
          ---------------



          Host ID String

          The host ID string is a message sent to the remote caller to
          identify  your system. It can be set to anything you desire.
          Be sure  to include a CR translation character at the end if
          you want one sent.

          Auto Answer String

          The  auto  answer  string  can  be  thought of  as  a  modem
          initialization  string for use with the host mode. Use it to
          set the  modem  to answer  correctly for  auto  answer.  The
          default string is '~~~+++~~~ATS0=1', where

               ~~~     is a 1 1/2 second pause
               +++     drops the modem into command state
               ~~~     is a 1 1/2 second pause
               AT      is the command prefix
               S0=1    sets modem to answer after one ring

          Host Mode Password

          This  is the password that  remote callers will have to know
          in  order to log onto  ProComm  in  host mode. Callers  must
          match  it completely including case. If you set this to null
          then callers  can get through the password by just  pressing
          RETURN.

          DOS Shell Password

          This is a secondary password  that  callers must know  to be
          allowed access to the remote DOS shell. Be very careful with
          this as you do not  want just anyone to have  access to  the
          DOS level on your machine.  You should not leave this blank,
          and you probably should not leave it at the default.


          ASCII Transfer Setup
          --------------------



          Echo Locally

          Use  this setting to control whether or not  ProComm  echoes
          locally what  is  being transferred during ASCII uploads. In
          most cases set this  to NO  and let the host due any echoing
          desired.

          Expand Blank Lines

          If set  on will  cause ProComm to  expand blank lines (lines
          containing only  a CR or CR/LF)  to include a space. This is
          useful when uploading text to systems that interpret a blank
          line to mean "end of text".

          Pace Character

          This is one  option for line pacing while uploading. If  set
          to a value other than 0, ProComm will send  a  line and then
          wait to receive the specified  character  before sending the
          next line. Enter  the decimal value for the  ASCII character
          desired; for instance, use 13 for a carriage return.

          Character Pacing

          You can cause ProComm to wait between each character sent in
          an ASCII upload  using  this parameter.  If set  to a  value
          other  than 0, ProComm will send  a character and  then wait
          the specified number  of milliseconds (1/1000 second) before
          sending another  character. Character pacing  may be used in
          conjunction with any of the other pacing options.

          Line Pacing

          ProComm performs line pacing during ASCII uploads if you  so
          desire. After each line  is sent the  program  will wait for
          the time specified  here (in 1/10 of seconds) before sending
          the next line. Pacing  may be  set to  zero if the  host can
          handle it.

          CR Translation (uploads)

          This option  controls outgoing CR translation  during  ASCII
          upload.  You have 3 options. If  set to NONE, no translation
          is  performed.  If  set  to  STRIP,  all  carriage   returns
          encountered in the file being  uploaded are stripped. If set
          to  ADD LF,  a  line feed  will  be  added to  all  outgoing
          carriage returns.

          LF Translation (uploads)

          This option  controls outgoing LF  translation  during ASCII
          upload. You have 3  options. If  set to NONE, no translation
          is performed. If set to STRIP, all line feeds encountered in
          the  file being uploaded are  stripped. If set to  ADD CR, a
          carriage return will precede all outgoing line feeds.

          CR Translation (downloads)

          This option  controls incoming CR  translation during  ASCII
          downloads.  You  have  3   options.   If  set  to  NONE,  no
          translation is  performed. If  set  to  STRIP,  all carriage
          returns encountered  in the file being received are stripped
          If set to ADD LF, a line feed  will be added to all incoming
          carriage returns.

          LF Translation (downloads)

          This  option  controls incoming  LF translation during ASCII
          downloads.  You   have  3  options.  If  set  to  NONE,   no
          translation  is performed. If set  to STRIP, all  line feeds
          encountered in the file  being  downloaded are  stripped. If
          set to ADD CR, a carriage return  will be added in  front of
          all received line feeds.


          DIALING DIRECTORY
          -----------------


          The ProComm dialing directory automates most of your dialing
          tasks. The directory holds information for  100 of your most
          often called systems. The information  includes the name and
          phone number, as well the communications parameters specific
          to that  entry.  Also included  in the  directory is a  user
          definable modem command  and up to  four long distance codes
          that you can use with  alternate long-distance services. You
          can even link command files to dialing directory entries  to
          provide custom  setup  configurations  or  to perform  logon
          sequences automatically.

          Press ALT-D to access  the dialing  directory. A  window  is
          opened  that  displays  pages of 10 entries at a  time.  The
          current  modem command is  displayed at the bottom left, and

          ProComm 2.3                                 Program Features





          the  active long  distance codes are indicated to the right.
          Long distance codes are  identified  by the characters  '+',
          '-', '@' and '#'. The modem command defaults to 'ATDT'.

          Use the PGUP  and PGDN keys to display the previous or  next
          page of entries.  The up and down arrow keys will scroll the
          display one entry  in  either direction. The  HOME key  will
          position the display at the  first  page in  the  directory,
          while the END key will position you at the  last page. Press
          ESC to exit the dialing directory.


          Searching for an Entry
          ----------------------


          Version  2.2  adds  a   search  capability  to  the  dialing
          directory. To look for a particular entry  press 'F' or '/'.
          A  window will open asking for the text to search for. Enter
          the string you wish  to be found and press CR.  ProComm will
          search  the name and number fields for the  string provided.
          If the string is found the dialing  directory will scroll to
          the  page  containing  that entry,  and the  entry  will  be
          highlighted.

          Searching  in the dialing directory is  not case  sensitive.
          For instance a  search  string of 'abcd' will  match 'abcd',
          'ABCD',  'AbCd'  or any other  mix  of upper and lower  case
          characters.  If the  search routine reaches  the end  of the
          dialing  directory  without  finding  a match it  will  wrap
          around to  the  beginning of the directory and  continue its
          search until it has checked every entry once.  If the string
          is still not found  a message  is  displayed.  To  repeat  a
          search for the same text, press 'F' or '/' a second time and
          then immediately press CR.


          Revising the Dialing Directory
          ------------------------------


          When you first use the dialing directory most of the entries
          will  be  cleared to  the default. The name and phone number
          fields will be filled with periods; the default baud rate is
          1200, with no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop  bit  and echo off
          (full duplex). To  add  an entry  to the  directory,  or  to
          change  an existing entry, enter 'R'  at the '==>' prompt. A
          window will appear asking for the entry to revise. To revise
          an entry type the number  of the entry to revise (1-100). To
          revise  the  modem  command enter  'M';  to  revise  a  long
          distance  code  enter  the  long  distance  code  identifier
          (-,+,@,#).

          Adding or Revising an Entry

          If  you chose to revise an entry the current values for that
          entry are  displayed. You are  prompted first  for the name.
          Enter up to  24 characters.  You  can use the backspace  and
          left arrow keys  to edit  your entry. Press  CR when you are
          done. Pressing CR  without making any changes will leave the
          current name intact. You will  now be prompted for the phone
          number. Enter only the numbers you need; the number  will be
          right justified  on the page. Press CR when you are finished
          entering the number. The current baud rate is now displayed.
          Press  any key  (except ESC) to rotate through the available
          baud rates. Press  CR to  select the  one you  want. Use the
          same  technique to select the parity,  data  bits, stop bits
          and echo.  You  will now  be prompted for  a command file to
          link to the entry. Enter the filename without any  extension
          or path. To clear an existing command file type  a space and
          then RETURN. If you don't want to link a  command file press
          RETURN without specifying  a filename. The same command file
          may be linked to any number of dialing directory entries.

          After specifying the command file, you will be asked whether
          to  save the entry to  disk. Enter 'Y' to save your changes,
          'N' to abandon. You may also abandon a revision at any point
          by pressing ESC. After saving an entry it is written to disk
          and the  current  page  redisplayed.  An entry  need not  be
          displayed to be revised.


          Revising the Modem Command

          If you specified 'M' to revise the modem command the current
          command  is   displayed.  Enter   a   new  command  that  is
          appropriate for your modem. You may imbed pauses,  CRs, ESCs
          or  control  characters  in  the  modem   string  using  the
          procedure   described  in  the  section   on  output  string
          translation. Press RETURN when you are done entering the new
          command.  Pressing  RETURN as  the  first  character of  the
          string will clear the command to blanks.

          Now indicate  if the new command should be saved to disk. If
          you enter 'Y' the new command is written to disk and will be
          used in  future executions of  ProComm.  If you say 'N'  the
          changes will remain for the current session only. To abandon
          the  changes  completely press  ESC  any  time  previous  to
          answering the save prompt.

          Any  changes  you  make  are  immediately reflected  in  the
          window.  You may also revise the dialing command through the
          setup facility described earlier.

          Adding or Revising Long Distance Codes

          Long  distance codes  are  mainly  used  to access alternate
          long-distance   services.  Four   long  distance  codes  are
          provided; they  are identified  by the  characters '-', '+',
          '@' and '#'. Press 'P'  at the dialing directory prompt '==>
          '  to display the current long distance codes. Press any key
          to remove the long distance code window.

          To revise a long distance code, enter the long distance code
          identifier  when  prompted  for the  entry  to  revise.  The
          current string for that long  distance code is displayed and
          you are  asked for  the new  entry.  Control  characters and
          carriage returns are allowed in long distance codes by using
          the same  conventions  as in the modem command. Press RETURN
          to complete the long distance code revision. Pressing RETURN
          as the  first character in  the new string deletes that long
          distance code. As with the modem command, if you specify not
          to save the  changes they will be in effect for the  current
          session  only.  Press ESC  to  abandon  long  distance  code
          changes completely.


          Deleting Entries
          ----------------


          You  can use  the 'D'  command to delete  entries  from your
          dialing  directory.  A window  will  prompt for  a range  of
          entries to delete. Leave the second field blank to  delete a
          single entry.  You'll be asked  to verify that  you want the
          entries deleted before any action is taken.


          Making a Call
          -------------


          To dial an entry in your dialing directory, simply  type the
          entry's number at  the '==> '  prompt.  To dial with a  long
          distance code,  place the  code's  identifier  before and/or
          after  the  number.  For example, enter '14' to  dial  entry
          number 14.  Enter '#37' to dial entry  number 37 preceded by
          the long  distance  code identified  by '#'. Enter '34+'  to
          dial entry number 34 followed by the '+' long distance code.
          ProComm will  send  the  modem  command,  an  optional  long
          distance  prefix,  then the  number  and  an  optional  long
          distance suffix  to the  modem. All  four  of  parts of  the
          dialing  string   are  translated   using   the  conventions
          described under  output  string translation.  The parameters
          for the dialed entry become the current settings and  remain
          after the call is complete.

          If a  command file is linked to the entry being  dialed, the

          redial facility will be used. When a  connection is  reached
          control is passed  to  the linked command file. This can  be
          very  useful for setting up  custom terminal configurations,
          performing automatic logons and much more.

          To  dial a  number not  in  your  directory  use  the manual
          dialing  command  ('M'). Then  enter the number you  wish to
          dial. ProComm will send  the dialing command plus the string
          you entered. A long distance code  indicator may be used  if
          it is the first or last character in the string.


          Printing the Directory
          ----------------------


          ProComm  lets you output your  directory  to a printer, disk
          file or any DOS device.  Type 'L'  at the  '==> ' prompt and
          then specify where  to send the file. Simply press RETURN to
          use  the default  of  PRN (LPT1:). You  can even  output the
          directory to the COM port you are using to send a listing of
          your directory to the remote computer.


          AUTOMATIC REDIAL WITH CIRCULAR DIALING QUEUE
          --------------------------------------------


          Some  remote  systems  can  be very  hard to reach.  ProComm
          facilitates reaching them with its automatic redial feature.
          Press ALT-R to invoke the redial procedure. Now  specify one
          or  more  dialing  directory  entries  separated  by blanks,
          commas or  semicolons.  Entries  may  contain  long distance
          codes. The  program  will continuously redial the numbers in
          the list  until you are  connected. ,sk Pressing CR  without
          specifying any entries will dial  the numbers that  were  in
          the list the last time it was used.

          If the redial time is exceeded, or ProComm senses one of the
          modem's no connect strings  (specified in the setup screen),
          the  program  will proceed to  dial the next  number  in the
          list. As  each  number is reached, it  is  removed from  the
          circular queue. To remove an entry that is being called from
          the list without  first connecting, press the DEL  key.  You
          can also  press the SPACE key to abort the current call  and
          proceed to the next entry in the list.

          You can set  the  amount  of  time  ProComm waits  for  some
          response by pressing  the END key. Specify the new  time  to
          wait  (5-100  seconds) and  press  RETURN. If you  want  the
          change to become permanent respond 'Y' to the 'save to disk'
          prompt. You can also specify this timeout delay in the setup
          screen.

          Between each call  ProComm will delay for the amount of time
          specified by the modem pause delay parameter (setup screen).
          This is  provided to allow some modems  a sufficient time to
          reset between  calls. To continue with  the next call  press
          the SPACE key.

          The alarm will  sound when you connect during a redial. If a
          command file  is  linked to  the  entry that has  connected,
          program control will pass to the linked command file.


          FILE TRANSFER
          -------------


          The  ability to transfer  information makes a communications
          program  a  very  powerful  tool.  ProComm  gives  you seven
          choices for  two-way information transfer via file  transfer
          protocols. With them  you  can up- and  download  files from
          almost  any system.  The different  protocols  are described
          below.


          Uploading Files
          ---------------


          Begin uploading  a  file  to another system  by starting the
          transfer on  the remote computer. When the remote  indicates
          it is ready press PgUp. You will be presented with a menu of
          protocol choices. Enter the number of  the protocol you wish
          to use. A second window will prompt you for the  name of the
          file to upload. Enter  the filename, including a path if you
          want,  and  press return.  Another window  will  open  which
          reports on the progress of the transfer.

          An ASCII upload is somewhat of a special  case. No  transfer
          progress window will  be  displayed but the status line will
          indicate  that  an  ASCII  transfer is  taking  place. ASCII
          uploads are under the control of 3 setup options. The  first
          option controls line pacing. You can set up ProComm to pause
          after it  sends each  line  of text to avoid overflowing the
          receiver.  You  can also  specify if  text is  to be  echoed
          locally  and  if  linefeeds  should  be  stripped  from  the
          outgoing file.


          Downloading Files
          -----------------


          Downloading  files is  just  as  easy.  After  starting  the
          download procedure  on the  remote press  PgDn. The protocol
          selection  window  is  displayed.  Enter the number  of  the

          protocol to use.

          If  you select  ASCII, XMODEM or YMODEM protocol you will be
          prompted for the filename. In all  other cases  the filename
          is provided  by the sender. If you enter the name of  a file
          that  already  exists you will be asked whether  or  not  to
          overwrite it. If a filename provided  by the  sender already
          exists the received file will be renamed by placing a dollar
          sign in the first position  of the filename. For example, if
          you  select to download FILE1.EXE using  the Telink protocol
          and that  file  already exists in the current directory, the
          downloaded file will be named $ILE1.EXE

          After  specifying the protocol and (possibly) the file name,
          a  window  will  open  which  displays  various  information
          regarding the transfer. When the transfer is complete, or an
          abort  is  sensed,  the  alarm  will sound  and  appropriate
          messages will be displayed.

          ASCII downloads are  somewhat  different from the  others in
          two respects. First, no transfer status window is displayed.
          A message  on  the  status  line  indicates  that  an  ASCII
          download is in affect. Second,  ASCII  downloads  need  user
          intervention to complete. Text is captured until  you  press
          ESC to terminate the transfer.

          Starting with version 2.3 we have provided a large degree of
          control over various  ASCII file transfer  parameters. These
          can be set from the setup  screen (ALT-S). There  are now  3
          pacing options, plus echo and  blank expansion  options. You
          can also conform CR and LF translation in a number  of ways,
          allowing you to transfer to or from most any system.


          File Transfer Protocols
          -----------------------



          ASCII

          ASCII  file transfer is the equivalent of typing information
          from one system to another. The ASCII characters are sent in
          a one-way stream with no handshaking (other  than XON/OFF if
          activated)  or error checking performed. This method is fine
          for  some applications,  but  you  are limited to text  file
          transfer.

          One difference between an ASCII download and file logging is
          that  all  data  (including  terminal  escape sequences)  is
          captured, whereas during  logging terminal control sequences
          are filtered out (with the exception of formfeeds).

          XMODEM File Transfer

          XMODEM  is a block-oriented error checking protocol released
          into  the public domain  by its creator Ward Christensen. It
          is very popular on electronic bulletin board systems. XMODEM
          transfers  only a single  file at a time. The protocol  uses
          two-way  communications and  either  a  checksum  or  cyclic
          redundancy check for error checking. XMODEM can handle  text
          or executable files with over 99% accuracy. ProComm supports
          and  automatically adjusts  for  both the checksum  and  CRC
          variants.

          The XMODEM protocol is  defined  such  that  CRC checking is
          always attempted  first.  If CRC is not acknowledged  by the
          sender then  the checksum method  is used. ProComm correctly
          implements  this,  however  some  other systems  do  not.  A
          problem can  arise if the remote system  responds to the CRC
          attempt but uses checksums.

          Note that XMODEM  requires transfers to be  performed with 8
          data bits, 1 stop bit and no parity. If you attempt to begin
          an  XMODEM transfer while set  to other  parameters, ProComm
          will automatically switch to  N/8/1, returning  you  to your
          original parameters when the transfer is complete.

          Some  systems, such as CompuServe, have  trouble meeting the
          standard  XMODEM  timing sequences.  You  may  set ProComm's
          XMODEM  facility  into  a  'relaxed'  mode,  which has  less
          critical  timing,  using  the  setup  (ALT-S)  screen.  Most
          systems will work fine with XMODEM set to normal.

          MODEM7 File Transfers

          MODEM7 is a variant  of the XMODEM protocol.  By sending the
          filename   batch   transfers   (multiple   files)   can   be
          accomplished. CRC and checksum are supported.

          YMODEM File Transfers

          YMODEM  is another XMODEM variant.  Its  main  advantage  is
          support  for  longer  data blocks to speed  transfer  times.
          ProComm supports YMODEM for single file transfers and YMODEM
          Batch  for   multiple  file  transfers.  YMODEM  Batch  also
          provides  some  header  information  such  as  filename  and
          filesize.  YMODEM file transfers are  always performed  with
          CRC error checking.

          Telink File Transfers

          Telink is yet another XMODEM/MODEM7 variant  which adds file
          size  and creation date information. It  is  found mainly on
          FIDO  bulletin board systems,  and provides  for batch  file
          transfers.

          Kermit File Transfer

          Kermit is a packet-oriented protocol  developed  at Columbia
          University  that is  available  on  many  different computer
          systems. By using a technique called 8th-bit quoting, Kermit
          is  able  to  transfer  binary  files  between  7 and 8  bit
          systems.  In  some implementations, such as ProComm,  Kermit
          supports multiple file transfers.

          Our implementation  of  Kermit  includes all  of the  latest
          kermit   enhancements,  such   as   data  compression,  file
          attributes, and sliding windows.

          The most significant of these features is sliding windows. A
          "sliding window" protocol is a full duplex protocol that can
          transmit  and  receive  data at  the same time.   The XMODEM
          family of  protocols are  half duplex protocols.  They  must
          wait between each block of  data for a reply from  the other
          side. This wastes a  lot of time. Full duplex protocols  can
          send  a continuous stream of data while receiving replies at
          the  same  time.  This   greatly  increases  file   transfer
          efficiency. ProComm  Kermit will automatically sense  if the
          other Kermit supports  sliding windows and will use them  if
          it does. Currently Sliding Window Kermit is available on The
          Source,  TCOMM  BBS, and PC-HOST BBS. Mainframe versions are
          under  development  and should  be  appearing soon.  ProComm
          Kermit is  backwards  compatible  with earlier  versions  of
          Kermit.

          ProComm's default kermit  settings  are fairly standard  and
          should only need  to be  changed under  special  conditions.
          Due to the sliding window enhancement, block size  should be
          limited  to  a maximum of 90,  rather than 94 as in standard
          Kermit.

          In addition,  a few Kermit server  commands  are  supported.
          Press  ALT-K  to access  the  Kermit  server  command  menu.
          Available  commands include Finish,  Logout,  Send  and Get.
          Finish (1) will terminate  the Kermit session and return you
          to  the system level. Logout (2)  will terminate  Kermit and
          log  you  off  the remote. Get (3)  and Send  (4) will  both
          prompt  for the appropriate filename and  then  perform  the
          indicated function.

          More  information  on  Kermit  is  available  from  Columbia
          University. Send $5 each for the Protocol or User manual to:

          TRANSLATE TABLE
          ---------------


          ProComm's translate table provides a means for you  to strip
          or replace characters you  receive from  the  remote.  Press
          ALT-W to display the current translation settings. The table
          will indicate  the  whether translation is currently  taking
          place, as well as showing you the current translation values
          for   the  ASCII  characters  0-127.  Press  F2  to  display
          translation values for characters 128-255. Pressing the keys
          F3 and F4 will  toggle the translation effect on or off. You
          may set the default condition using the setup screen.

          To  change a  translation value,  enter  the ASCII  code  to
          reset. Now enter the translated  value (both in decimal). To
          strip an unwanted character, translate it to 0. Press  F1 to
          save  translation  values between  sessions.  Press  ESC  to
          return to terminal mode.


          COMMAND FILES
          -------------


          Command files are text files you create that contain ProComm
          commands. You  can  use command  files to perform  automatic
          logons, do unattended  file transfers and many  other tasks.
          You  can  even  link command  files to the  entries in  your
          dialing directory.

          Create  a command file using  your favorite  word processor.
          You  may  use any valid filename; however, ProComm looks for
          files  with  an extension of  .CMD  when it  lists available
          command  files.  Use the commands described below to perform
          your  specific  task.  Be sure to  test  your command  files
          thoroughly before using them for unattended communications.

          You can execute  command files from within  ProComm or  as a
          command  line option  when  you first invoke the program. If
          you specify them on the command line, using the '/F' option,
          they  will  be  executed immediately upon  program  startup.
          Execute them inside the program by pressing  ALT-F5. ProComm
          first searches  for  files with  the  .CMD extension  in the
          current directory. If  any  are found they are  displayed in
          the window. If none are found ProComm looks in the directory
          pointed to by the PROCOMM environment variable. Again, if it
          finds  any they are displayed in  the  window, otherwise the
          message  'NO FILES' is  displayed. You may then specify  the
          command by file  name,  or chose  from the scrolling  window
          display.

          To chose from the scrolling window, position the highlighted
          bar on  the name of  the file you wish  to execute and press

          enter. PGUP and  PGDN  will  scroll the window one  page  in
          either direction. The cursor keys will scroll the window one
          entry  in  either  direction.  Pressing  the HOME  key  will
          position you at the first page  of  available command files;
          pressing END will position you at the last.

          If you begin to enter a command file name at  the prompt you
          may still scroll  the  window but you may not select a  file
          for execution from the scrolling display. You can leave  the
          .CMD extension off when executing  command files  explicitly
          by name.

          You can  abort  a command file  by  pressing  ESC during its
          execution.  The command  file will  abort  when  the current
          command has  completed (this might take  a few seconds).  In
          some cases,  such as  while  dialing or  performing  a  file
          transfer, two  ESCs are needed:  one  to abort  the task  in
          progress and a second to abort the command file.

          There is  a special command file named  PROFILE.CMD. ProComm
          will look for this file in the default  directory first, and
          then in the directory pointed to by the PROCOMM= environment
          variable  discussed above.  If  it  is  found,  it  will  be
          executed immediately upon  program startup. You can  use the
          profile to do  custom  setup work like changing to a special
          directory,  turning off  the  sound,  changing communication
          parameters or  overriding  the default modem  initialization
          string.

          Command file instructions all have  the  same  general form.
          Each  must  begin  with  a  percent  sign  ('%'),   followed
          immediately by a 1 to  3 character command. Commands  may be
          in  either upper or lower case.  All other characters in the
          file are ignored and may be used as comments.

          Many commands also require an additional argument. There are
          two conventions for specifying arguments. If the argument is
          enclosed  in quote  marks (the  double  quote  char:"), that
          argument is used. If the argument is enclosed in  tick marks
          (the single quote char:'), a window is opened which uses the
          specified argument to prompt the user for the real argument.
          For example,  the command %XUK"FILE1.EXE"  causes  the  file
          FILE1.EXE to be  uploaded via Kermit.  The command %XUK'FILE
          TO UPLOAD' will open a window containing the prompt 'FILE TO
          UPLOAD'.  The user must  then specify the  file he wishes to
          have uploaded.  That  filename is  then passed to the Kermit
          upload procedure and  execution continues.  Be  very careful
          that  you do not specify arguments  to be prompted  for in a
          command file that is to execute without user supervision.

          We have provided several  command files  for  accessing  the
          popular  information  services.  Look  at  these  files  for
          examples of correct command usage.

          ProComm 2.3                                 Program Features





          ProComm currently supports the following commands:

          %A - Alarm

          This command will sound an alarm to alert you to some event.
          Set  the alarm time from  the setup  screen or using the %ST
          command. This  command is also  under  control of  the alarm
          on/off  setting   from  the  setup  screen,  which  may   be
          controlled by the %SA command.

          %B"directory" - Change default directory

          This command will change the  default directory or drive. It
          will not do both at once however. For instance, the  command
          %B"A:DIR1" will make  DIR1  the  current directory for drive
          a:,  but it  will NOT make ProComm change  default drives to
          a:. Use a command like %B"A:" to change drives.

          %C"ldcode number ldcode" - Call a number

          Use  the call command to  dial  an  entry  in  your  dialing
          directory.  Specify  the  number of  the  entry,  optionally
          preceded and/or followed by a long distance code identifier,
          as the  quoted  argument.  For  example. the command %C"#24"
          will  dial  entry number  24  using  the long distance  code
          identified  by  '#'.  This  command  uses  the  auto  redial
          facility to place its calls; it will keep re-dialing until a
          connection is made. Use the '%R' command described  below to
          change the redial wait delay.

          If you  sort your dialing directory you will  need to change
          your command files so the entry numbers match.

          If a command file is linked via the dialing directory to the
          entry being dialed,  the  linked command  file will  not  be
          executed. Place all statements to be executed in the command
          file which initiates the call.

          %D"command to execute" - DOS Command

          This feature  allows you to  execute a  DOS command or other
          program from the command file. Enter the command as it would
          appear  on  the DOS command  line between  the  quotes.  For
          example, to go out to  DOS and type  a file to  your printer
          use the  command  %D"type  filename  >  prn".  This  command
          requires  two  things:  enough  memory  and  the environment
          variable COMSPEC= set  correctly. CAUTION: If you execute  a
          program  or command  requiring  user input be sure  you  are
          around to provide it, as the program will wait until you do.

          %Ex - Emulations, where x is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 or 9

          Use  this command to specify which terminal emulation is  to
          be used.

          HOST MODE
          ---------


          Beginning with  version 2.3, we have included a limited host
          mode to  allow remote  access of  your computer. It features
          password  protection,  file transfers, operator page and DOS
          shell  access.  It can  also  display  a  canned  message or
          graphic screen, and maintain a history of logons.

          Host mode requires some setup before it is used.  There is a
          setup  screen  that  contains 4  host  options  that must be
          correctly  initialized.  The first  option  is  the  host ID
          string. This is merely a text message that is displayed when
          someone calls in. The second option is the modem auto-answer
          string. This is the command sent  to the  modem to  place it
          into auto  answer mode. The  default string is set for Hayes
          compatible modems and is '~~~+++~~~ATS0=1', where

               ~~~     is a 1 1/2 second pause
               +++     drops the modem into command state
               ~~~     is a 1 1/2 second pause
               AT      is the command prefix
               S0=1    sets modem to answer after one ring

          When host  mode is  terminated the regular modem init string
          is sent to reset the modem. If you don't want auto-answer to
          be on when you are not  in host mode, include the command to
          turn it off  (i.e.  S0=0 for Hayes)  within the  modem  init
          string.  The third host option is the host access  password.
          It may  be up to 8 characters in length. Callers must  match
          the password  exactly including  case.  If  you set this  to
          null, callers need only press RETURN at the password prompt.
          The  last  host  option is  the  DOS  shell  password.  This
          provides  a  second  level  of  password  protection  before
          callers have  access  to the system level.  Be very  careful
          with this one; you don't want  just anyone to have access to
          the operating system level on your machine.

          Some other  settings  are  also  very  important  to correct
          operation  of host mode.  Within ProComm, the carrier detect
          mask (CD mask) MUST be set correctly for your  modem (the CD
          mask is discussed elsewhere  in this  manual).  In addition,
          your modem should be set to follow the true state of carrier
          detect  (CD) and data  terminal ready (DTR);  that  is,  the
          modem cannot  hold these values true,  or high. Consult your
          modem manual for details specific to that modem.

          To place ProComm into host mode press ALT-Q. The auto-answer
          string is  set to the modem and  the local console  displays
          "Waiting...". A line is added to PROCOMM.HST, the host audit
          trail history file, that records the  time and date. When  a
          call comes in, and a connect occurs, ProComm issues the host
          ID string and prompts the user for his name. The name is for

          informational  purposes  only.  After  the caller enters his
          name  it  is recorded  in the  history  file.  ProComm  then
          prompts for  password. The caller must  match  the  password
          completely  including  case.  All  password  attempts,  both
          successful and  otherwise, are recorded in the history file.
          Callers get three chances to match the password. If they are
          unsuccessful after three tries ProComm will hang up on them.

          When the caller makes  it  past  the  password, ProComm will
          attempt to display  the  contents of  a special file  called
          PROCOMM.MSG. You can  use this file as a welcome message, to
          display graphics  or whatever. Every  23 lines  ProComm will
          halt, display a "[MORE]" message, and wait for any keystroke
          from the caller. When a keystroke is received display of the
          file continues. Use of the .MSG file is optional.

          After  PROCOMM.MSG  is  displayed, if  it  is, the caller is
          presented with the host menu:

               F)iles   C)hat   D)ownload   U)pload   S)hell   G)oodbye

          Callers make  their choices by entering the  first letter of
          an option.

          The F)iles option will  send  a  list of  the  files  in the
          current directory to the caller.  The list is  not displayed
          on the local console. F)iles uses the same facility that the
          ALT-F command uses.  See the  section on  File Directory for
          more details.

          If the  caller chooses C)hat  an alarm  is  sounded  for  30
          seconds. Press SPACE to  chat with  the caller. Pressing any
          other key will end the alarm and redisplay the host menu. If
          you have the alarm  sound  set  off (via general  setup)  no
          bells will sound  on  the local  end. Press ESC when you are
          done chatting to return to the host menu.

          D)ownload and U)load work pretty  much the same.  The caller
          is presented with the file transfer menu:

               K)ermit   M)odem7   T)elink   X)modem   Y)modem batch

          After  selecting a protocol the caller may be prompted for a
          filename depending upon the  transfer direction and protocol
          used.  The  standard  file transfer  routines  are  used  to
          perform the transfers.

          The S)hell command is very powerful and has the potential of
          being very dangerous. It performs the equivalent  of a 'CTTY
          COMx' command, which basically redirects all console I/O out
          the com port. This command puts the caller in charge of your
          computer at the operating system level. This means that they
          can format your disk  or whatever, so be  very, very careful
          who you allow to access this command. Use the shell password

          to protect yourself.

          There  are some restrictions when using  the shell  command.
          For one,  do  not run programs  that write  directly  to the
          screen buffer.  If the host machine is running Dosedit,  CED
          or a similar program, backspaces, escapes and possibly other
          key sequences can lock up the machine.  This problem relates
          to DOS  and the other programs.  There is  nothing we can do
          about it. In  addition, some machines we have  tried this on
          do  not  pipe I/O to the  correct  port.  We  have  not  yet
          determined if this is  a DOS or BIOS problem,  but be  aware
          that  it  may occur.  We suggest  you  thoroughly test  this
          feature before making it available to callers.

          The  G)oodbye option logs the caller out and places a notice
          to that effect in the history file.

          On the  local side, the host has several  options. Press ESC
          to leave host mode.  Press  CTRL-X  to  log off the  current
          user. All other keystrokes  act as  if the caller sent them;
          you can help novice users through the menus that way.

          NOTE: Host  mode,  especially the shell command, opens a few
          more  files.  Be sure  that  the  FILES= statement  in  your
          CONFIG.SYS file is set high enough. We recommend FILES=15.


          CHAT MODE
          ---------


          ProComm  features  a  split  screen  chat  mode  for  online
          conversations. Incoming text (and echoed outgoing text if in
          full duplex) is displayed in the top 18 lines of the screen.
          Outgoing text is displayed in the bottom 4 lines.

          Activate  chat mode by pressing ALT-O. Limited line  editing
          is provided for outgoing text. You can use backspace to edit
          a  line  before it goes out. Text is sent to the remote only
          after a carriage return or when  the buffer gets full (about
          3 lines). One exception is that CTRL-Q and CTRL-S keystrokes
          (XON and XOFF) get sent immediately.

          Printer and disk logging will  occur  if  it is  active when
          chat mode begins.  ALT-F6 (redisplay buffer) is available in
          chat mode. Press ESC to exit chat mode.


          KEYBOARD MACROS
          ---------------


          Another  useful  feature provided  by  ProComm  is  keyboard
          macros. This facility allows you to assign character strings


          Copyright (C) 1986 PIL Software Systems                   43



          ProComm 2.3                                 Program Features





          to each of the keys  ALT-0 through ALT-9. The strings may be
          up  to  24 characters  in  length, and may contain  imbedded
          control  codes  and  carriage  returns  using the  translate
          conventions described elsewhere. To  send the  string you've
          assigned, simply press the appropriate key.

          Access  the keyboard macros by pressing ALT-M  from terminal
          mode.  A  window   will  appear  listing   the  current  key
          assignments. To revise an assignment press 'R', and then the
          key to assign (ALT-0 through ALT-9). Now type the string you
          wish assigned to that key. Respond 'Y' to the save prompt to
          make  the assignment permanent; otherwise, it  is discarded.
          Press ESC to return to terminal mode.


          DOS GATEWAY
          -----------


          ProComm provides a  gateway  to DOS  to allow you to execute
          DOS  commands or other programs without  ending the  ProComm
          session  -  just  press  ALT-F4.  ProComm  uses the  COMSPEC
          environment variable  to determine the  name of the  command
          processor to use, so that variable must be set correctly for
          the gateway  to work.  Enter 'EXIT' on the  DOS command line
          when you wish to return to ProComm. CAUTION: executing other
          communications  programs  through   the  gateway  may  cause
          erratic results when you return to ProComm.


          EDITOR
          ------


          To call an  editor, word  processor or  other  program  from
          within ProComm,  press ALT-A. ProComm  will attempt to  find
          and load  the  program  named in setup screen. This  can  be
          quite useful  for  viewing  a file,  doing  some  editing or
          whatever. The conditions described above for the DOS gateway
          must  be  met  for this  feature  to  perform correctly.  In
          addition, the  program to  be  executed  must reside in  the
          current directory or in a directory that is  included in the
          PATH.

          There is no default for this feature so be sure to set it up
          before attempting to use it.


          SCREEN DUMP
          -----------


          Pressing ALT-G produces a screen dump of the  current screen
          contents. Screen contents are appended  to the  current .IMG


          Copyright (C) 1986 PIL Software Systems                   44

          file, which may be  specified  using  the  setup screen. The
          default screen dump file is PROCOMM.IMG.


          FILE AND PRINTER LOGGING
          ------------------------


          ProComm   provides  2  alternatives  to  file  transfer  for
          capturing  information:  file  and  printer  logging.  After
          initiating the  logging  procedure,  any information  coming
          from  the remote system is routed  to the log as well as the
          screen.

          Press ALT-L to begin capturing information to  your printer.
          A message on the status line will indicate that  the printer
          log  is open. ProComm  writes the  logged  data  to  the DOS
          device PRN. You  may use the  DOS 'MODE' command to redirect
          PRN. Press ALT-L again to toggle printer logging off.

          Data can be  captured to disk by using  the ALT-F1  command.
          Specify the name of the file to be used, or  press RETURN to
          use the default. If the file already exists, new information
          will be  appended  at  the end of the file. Press ALT-F2  to
          suspend information capture without  closing the log file. A
          message  will be displayed on the bottom  line of the screen
          indicating logging status.

          Terminal  control sequences  are  not  included  in  the log
          files, with the exception of formfeeds.


          SETTING DISPLAY COLORS
          ----------------------


          To set colors enter ALT-Z  from terminal mode. A window will
          open  with  a list of window  selections  on  the  left  and
          instructions  on the right. Press the up  or down arrow keys
          to  choose  a  selection  to change. Next, press the left or
          right  arrow   keys  to   choose  which  colors  to   change
          (background, foreground,  or hi-lighted). Pressing the space
          bar will  cycle between the  possible colors. After you have
          set  all the colors you desire,  press ESC to exit. You will
          then be asked if you want to save the color changes to disk.
          If you save the  changes to disk, they will remain until you
          change  them again, otherwise  they will remain only for the
          current session.

          Some  windows do  not  appear  in the  window list  but  are
          settable anyway. The ALT-T, ALT-B and ALT-X windows use  the
          same  colors as  the  keyboard  macros  window.  The  redial
          display  uses the phone directory  colors. The setup screens
          use  the help window colors. Communication screen colors are

          used in the  redisplay  section.  The script  file selection
          window uses the file transfer window colors.


          REDISPLAY BUFFER
          ----------------


          To redisplay lines that have scrolled off your screen, press
          ALT-F6.  ProComm  will display the last 4000 characters that
          have come in.

          Use the  PgUp and PgDn  keys  to  scroll one page  in either
          direction. Use  the up and  down arrow keys to move one line
          in either direction. Pressing the Home key  will take you to
          the first  page of the  redisplay buffer, while pressing the
          End key will take you to  the  last. To  search for specific
          text press 'F' or '/'. You will be prompted for the  text to
          search for. If the text if found ProComm will scroll to  the
          page it is on and highlight what it found. To search for the
          same text again use the same keystroke  and then press ENTER
          when prompted for the  text to  look  for. Searches are  not
          case sensitive.


          FILE DIRECTORY
          --------------


          Press ALT-F to get  a directory listing of your files. Enter
          a filespec  at the  prompt just as you would  in the DOS DIR
          command. Paths and drives are supported. COMSPEC must be set
          correctly for this feature to work.


          VIEW A FILE
          -----------


          To  examine a  file that  exists on your  system type ALT-V.
          You'll  be  prompted for the  name  of  the file.  Enter the
          complete filename, including drive  and path  designator  if
          desired. Use the PGUP  and PGDN keys  to  page  through  the
          file. Press HOME to go to the  beginning  of the file. Press
          ESC to abort the viewing procedure.


          PROGRAM INFORMATION
          -------------------


          To display  the  ProComm program  information screen,  press
          ALT-I. Type any key to return.

          CHANGE LOGGED DRIVE OR DIRECTORY
          --------------------------------


          ProComm allows  you to change the default  directory or  the
          logged drive you are  working in. Just press  ALT-B and give
          the name of the new directory or drive. All downloaded files
          are  placed in the current default directory, as well as log
          files you create.


          DISPLAY ELAPSED TIME
          --------------------


          Pressing ALT-T will  display the  current time and  date, as
          well as  the elapsed  time  since  the  last call  was made.
          Elapsed time is reset  every time you make  a call using the
          dialing directory, and when  you make a connection using the
          redial facility.


          CLEAR SCREEN
          ------------


          Press  ALT-C to  clear your screen and home the cursor. This
          is a local effect only.


          HANG-UP
          -------


          Press  ALT-H  to hang-up your  telephone connection. ProComm
          accomplishes this  by first attempting to drop DTR.  If this
          fails,  then the modem hang-up string is sent to  the modem.
          ProComm uses  the "carrier  detect mask" in the setup screen
          to determine if the hang-up was successful.  Most modems use
          a mask of 32 or  128.  If you  receive the  "HANG UP FAILED"
          message after  pressing ALT-H. perform the following checks:
          Be sure  your modem is set to monitor DTR and CD. If hang-up
          still  fails, check  that the  modem  hang-up string in  the
          setup screen is  correct for your modem.  If it still fails,
          try  different values  for  the carrier  detect mask.   Some
          common values are 16, 32, 48, and 128.


          TOGGLE DUPLEX
          -------------


          ALT-E will  toggle duplex between  full and half.  ProComm's
          default  duplex is set by the user  in the setup screen.  If

          characters you type appear twice you  should  set duplex  to
          full. Likewise, if you type something that is not  displayed
          try  toggling duplex to half. A message is briefly displayed
          on the status line when you toggle this setting.


          TOGGLE CR - CR/LF
          -----------------


          Some  remote  systems  delimit  lines  of  text with  single
          carriage returns, while  others use a  carriage  return/line
          feed combination.  ProComm  can  add  a  line  feed  to each
          incoming carriage  return if  needed. Use  ALT-F3  to toggle
          this on and  off.  The  default is  CR  only. If text  lines
          overwrite  each  other, the  remote  is not sending LFs,  so
          switch to CR/LF.  If text appears  double  spaced use the CR
          setting. A message is briefly displayed when you toggle this
          option.


          BREAK
          -----


          Pressing  CTRL-BREAK  will cause  a 350 millisecond  spacing
          condition (break)  on  the  line.  On some non IBM  machines
          pressing  CTRL-BREAK can cause  a lockup; therefore we  have
          provided  another keystroke,  ALT-F7, which will  also cause
          the break condition to occur. Use the keyboard macro feature
          if  you require a specific character be sent for the  remote
          to realize a break.


          ENDING A PROCOMM SESSION
          ------------------------


          When  your communications  work  is  finished, press  ALT-X.
          You'll be asked to  verify that you wish to leave. Enter 'N'
          to continue working or 'Y' to exit.

          Appendix A                                Terminal Emulation





                                    Overview


          ProComm  emulates a  number of  popular  terminals.  ProComm
          handles most  of  the standard  features  and  many  of  the
          extended features of the terminals  emulated.  Functions  of
          these terminals that are not emulated are still processed to
          insure that all control codes are handled properly.

          Due to the wide  variety of protocol convertors on mainframe
          front-end   processors,  some  keys  may   not  function  as
          expected.   These  emulations  have  been  tested  with  the
          mainframe systems  at the University  of  Missouri, Columbia
          and the University  of  California,  Berkeley,  as  well  as
          within private  industry. If  you encounter a problem, refer
          to the TRANSMITTED  CODES column in the  terminal  emulation
          charts on the following pages to see  if ProComm is  sending
          the code your protocol convertor is expecting.

          If  you encounter any errors in these emulations or have any
          questions, please let us know.

                 Digital Equipment Corporation VT-100 and VT-102


          ProComm supports the standard VT-100  and VT-102  functions.
          Supported  functions include:  full/half  duplex,  set/reset
          modes,  scroll region, special graphics character set, US 50
          UK character sets, keypad application mode, cursor  control,
          erase  functions,  insert/delete  lines,  and  full  display
          attributes  (including extensions  for ANSI color/graphics).
          132 column mode is not  supported.  ProComm responds  to the
          the  Identify and Device Attributes commands  with ESC[?1;2c

                                    ANSI-BBS


          This  is  the  recommended emulation  for use  with bulletin
          board systems that use ANSI graphics and color. the ANSI-BBS
          mode  processes the ANSI  codes given  in the DOS  technical
          reference manual, and behaves  in the same manner as the DOS
          ANSI.SYS device driver. (ProComm  does not  use the ANSI.SYS
          driver itself.)  This emulation is  similar  to  the  VT-100
          emulation, but  the  VT-100 emulation handles normal,  bold,
          and reverse video in a different manner. The VT-100 keyboard
          mapping is used with this emulation.

          Appendix C                                     Command Files





          All commands  start  with  '%'.  The command  letter(s) must
          immediately follow the '%', and  may be upper or lower case.
          All arguments must be  enclosed  in quotes ("")or tick marks
          (''), and must immediately follow  the command letters.  All
          other characters in the file are ignored, and may be used as
          comments.  ProComm looks for an  extension  of  .CMD when it
          lists available command files.

          When using the 'I'  command, the strings must match  exactly
          in  case.  Use  the  'P' command to set the amount  of  time
          ProComm waits for the  incoming character string to be found
          (default is 30).

          Strings  to be transmitted ('T' command) use the translation
          conventions  described  in  the  section  on  output  string
          translation.

                         Timed Execution Facility (TEF)



          The  ProComm  Timed  Execution  Facility is  a  stand  alone
          program that allows execution of a ProComm command file at a
          predetermined time.

          TEF is  started from the DOS prompt  by typing  the command:
          TEF

          TEF will prompt you for the  name of  a ProComm command file
          and the time to start its execution. TEF will wait until the
          specified time and then load and execute  ProComm passing in
          the name of the command file.

          The time must be entered in  military format.  The hour must
          be 0-23 and  the  minutes must be 0-59.  Pressing ESC at any
          time will abort TEF.  Pressing  F1  will allow you to change
          the command file and execution  time. Pressing F2 will blank
          the screen. (Pressing  any other key  will  turn  the screen
          back on).

          TEF can also be run in a batch mode. Specify commands on the
          command line like:

               TEF cmdfile XX:XX






                      Dialing Directory Conversion Utility



          ProComm is distributed  with  a dialing directory conversion
          program called CONVERT.EXE. Use CONVERT to change PC-TALK or
          QMODEM  dialing  directories to  ProComm format. To execute,
          type: CONVERT on  the  DOS command line  and then follow the
          prompts.

          NOTE: When converting QMODEM directories only the  first 100
          entries will  be converted. In  addition, the modem  command
          will not be converted and will default to ATDT.

          Appendix E                              Answers to Questions





          Question:

          ALT-H doesn't work with my modem. What's wrong?

          Answer:

          ProComm first attempts to  hang up by dropping the DTR  line
          to the modem. Your modem must  monitor the DTR line for this
          to work. Users of Hayes external modems must have switch one
          in  the open  (up)  position.  Owners  of  the  newer  Hayes
          internals  must have  a jumper correctly  set. Consult  your
          modem manual  for further  details.  If  your  configuration
          prevents the use of DTR in hanging up, ProComm can also send
          a  hangup string.  After  attempting to drop DTR the program
          checks carrier detect to see  if you are still online. If so
          it will  send the hangup string you  have specified  in  the
          setup screen.


          Question:

          When using  the redial facility, or  making  a call  from  a
          command file, the program  doesn't  realize when I've made a
          connection.

          Answer:

          Make sure that  ProComm's modem connect string is  correctly
          defined for  the  message  your modem  returns  for  carrier
          detect. The ProComm default is "CONNECT".


          Question:

          I  sometimes  have  trouble  opening  files  for logging  or
          downloading.

          Answer:

          ,pi   /CONFIG.SYS  You  may  need  to  increase  the  FILES=
          parameter in your CONFIG.SYS file. We suggest using at least
          FILES=15. Consult your DOS manual for more details.


          Question:

          I can't get  the dialing directory  to  call using the  long
          distance code I've put in the number.

          Answer:

          Specify the long  distance  code to be used when you make to
          call  itself,  not  when  you  enter  the  number  into  the
          directory.  For instance, say "#37"  at the  "==>" prompt to

          dial  entry  number  37  using  the '#' long distance  code.
          Entering a long distance code as part of the number will not
          work.


          Question:

          I'm having trouble getting ProComm to work with my PCjr. Any
          ideas?

          Answer:

          The  PCjr  is somewhat  different  in  the  way  it  handles
          communications. A solution that has worked for  a  number of
          users  is this: Call  our BBS  and  download a  file  called
          COMSWAP.ARC. After  un-arcing the  file  you  should find  2
          programs called  COMSWAP.COM  and  COMREST.COM. Run  COMSWAP
          before  running  ProComm  and run  COMREST  after. Then  use
          ProComm set to COM2:.


          Question:

          When I call your bulletin board my  modem  connects but then
          nothing else happens. What's wrong?

          Answer:

          The  Fido BBS software, and a number of other  BBS programs,
          require some input so that the modems can determine the baud
          rate and  start their handshake. After  connecting, send the
          remote several carriage returns. If you are calling  a  Fido
          at 2400 baud you should send several SPACES instead.


          Question:

          When I'm using a multi-tasking operating  system and running
          ProComm in the background, window displays  bleed through to
          the active partition.

          Answer:

          Go into the general setup screen and  set ProComm to use the
          BIOS screen  write  method. It  is much slower but  will not
          cause the bleed through that you are experiencing.


          Question:

          When I try to use the DOS gateway it says 'Command processor
          not found'. What does this mean?

          Answer:


          Copyright (C) 1986 PIL Software Systems                   66



          Appendix E                              Answers to Questions





          In order to use the gateway, ProComm must  load  a secondary
          copy  of the command  processor (COMMAND.COM). It  uses  the
          environment  variable COMSPEC  to  determine  the  name  and
          location  of the command processor. COMSPEC is set  when you
          boot  to the drive, directory and  program  you booted from.
          Problems can arise if you boot off a floppy, and then change
          the  floppy in the  boot disk drive. To use the gateway, and
          the ALT-F function, be sure that COMSPEC is set and that the
          command processor is where COMSPEC says it is.


          Question:

          I can't  use the  help  screen  because  MultiLink grabs the
          ALT-F10 keystroke before ProComm can get it.

          Answer:

          MultiLink  provides an  'escape'  keystroke  to  avoid  that
          problem.  Simply press  ALT-F9  before pressing  ALT-F10 and
          MultiLink will let the ALT-F10 through to ProComm.
